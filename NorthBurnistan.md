### The Anthems

The national anthem was supposed to be a glorious ode the beauty of the country and the benevelance of the Supreme Leader. Unfortunately it seems like the Peoples round the back of North Burnistanm or at least they claimed it was them., infiltrated the recording studio and managed to change a few aspects with the song. And in an entirely separate infiltrations the Popular peoples front of North Burnistation (I am operating finders keeper rules here as there was around 140 that different freedom groups made over those two events.) managed to convince the studio producers that the 700 agents that were out chasing the Peoples round the back of North Burnistanm members from the initial infiltration had told them to tell the producers to put out the recording as it was.

Obviously this embarrassment would not go un-answered and as the initial artist has already been "Exported" a new one was found and asked to record the original so but this time the Northern But a little to the East Indcidental Regualars (or one or the 356 other claimants) manage to switch the tapes given to the recording artist. Who had been locked up in isolation for fear of another such incident and as such had no one to check the song with. She barely had lift her finger from the publish button before somewhere in the palance the Export rubber stamp had hit her documents.
