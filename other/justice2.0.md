# Justice

During the meeting where the RIST Team had been introduced I have kinda volunteered. But because I hadn't jumped out my seat I got missed.. and I didn't chase the point at the time firstly as Leo knows what I am like with data collection so I figured it wouldn't take much for them to think they had me *shrugs* But I was already thinking about the next thing. 
If you check the logs from that meet... The next thing I say was.. 

> Why not have each side argue the opposing sides points?

Again maybe I should have pushed that more.. But I am fairly sure it could seriously change a hell of a lot of stuff in the world.

  - I would suggest a new system of justice at this point. 

In the investigation of a disput two people/groups are assigned to either be defence or offence. 
They are not told which they are to be and must be prepared to be able to take on both sides of the arguement. 
Until the actual "trial" begins, neither will know which they are to be. 
The first thing that happens in the trial is that a coin is flipped. That picks who starts in what role. 
Then after a set number of points they will switch, however either the judge and/or jury  or whatever would some how score each point.
The next round you are allowed 1 point + the number of points you won in the last round. 
My reason for suggesting this is that it doesn't matter about the skill or effort of one side over the other because over several switchs that is averaged out.  
The end result is averaged out. 
Both sides will have a full picture of what is going on. 
With the structured points system like that then the end result will be the best compromise between the two sides.  
If there is any percievable bias between either side has then they are at risk of loosing that chance to promote their own side.
