## Intro

### Background

Okay, Just so everyone is on the same page. I was Lead of DPW for '08 and '09 for Burning Life. That was the the event that eventually turned into Burn2. The event back then was a little bigger and had Linden backing. That did mean easier access to Sim as such '08 was 24 sims and then '09 was 35.  
Whilst I get it's a bit of a different matter operating under those parameters, I would consider myself to be fairly experienced with putting on an event such as this.  

### DPW/ART/Placement

So, "Placement", wasn't a thing back then. What is currently placement actually came under the banner of DPW and Art Dept.  
That meant that for the most part I was give the map of Burning Man, shown how many sims and in what layout they were, As well as figures that were wanted. It was my role to take those details and come up with the entire layout. I worked with the Art Lead on placements of the artplots and the other leads to establish if their departments had any particular requirements.  
I spent a good while outside the front of my hut in Deep Hole planning out the layout in prim at 1:100 scale.

That was "Placement", I wasn't really in charge of it. I sat somewhere that everyone knew where I was and I made everyone who stopped by and made requests work together with everyone else. I did have final decisions, but only on things that no one voiced an opinion on. If one person voiced and opinion the I would incorporate that. If someone else then request something contrary to something in place, I would just tell they about the conflict and send them off to resolve it. If both parties came back with a resolution then I would amend.

ART and DPW worked closely together to make everything happen. DPW was more so than anything the safety net. Art kept it Burner.  
Prime example for '09, Both the secondary stages Berlin and Tokyo fell through last moment when their builders had to step back from their roles. I had to find builders that would pass the "Burner enoughâ€¦" test from the Art Dept. and who I could trust enough to not only get the builds done but get them done in half the time that everyone else had had and not have it look that way..  

## Layout Stages

### Initial Layout

Dpw works with event lead, art dept and performance to plan the actual layout, in that stage performance area and art plot are marked out.

### "Theme" Layout

Art dept has ultimate control over artplots, for the most part that was a curated affair, so that the overall theme would be consistent. Artists actually are brough in earliest.. Art Dept would ideally have a list of invited artists  
HUBS is a new thing for me.. That I would suggest be be sorted out as early as possible. They being large areas of themed camps would ideal be planned for at the same time as the theme layout.

The point of this stage is to get your big rocks in place. In the book 7 habits there is the jam jar method of organising tasks. i.e. When you are planning for something it's like you have jam jar with a limited amount of space. The only way to efficiently fit everything in is to start with your largest stones first and then progressively work your want doing to smaller and smaller grade till you get to sand.  
If you work in any other way you end up will a smaller grade settling and then larger layers will sit on the top of them. e.g. placing the sand in the jar first would mean you have a layer of sand and then the gravel you place afterward would just sit on top of it.

#### At the End of This Stage

The placement of the Stage should be settled and performance can start working to actually builder the stages.  
The placement of HUB Communities should have been decided and their placement all sorted ideal the artists brough on site and will have seen their plots and have ideally given some clue as to what they intend to do.  
HUBS Leaders/Liaison likewise should also have been to the site and should have given a rough idea on what makes there community different.  
DPW by this stage should have marked out locations to give a basic understanding on where infrastructure builds would be based. i.e. Every dept should have been assigned the location of their main infrastructure build.

### Solidification Stage

This is the "Oh Shit!" stage for DPW as it's when all the parcels are made roads are placed etc.  
Step 1. Major plots are cut this allows buildeer to actually come start placing prims  
Step 2. Major artplots and Dept HQ are cut allowing for those builder to come start their work  
Step 3. Roads get placed.  
Step 4. Smaller plots are cut.  
Step 5. "Terminals" are placed.  

#### "Terminals"

Terminals were pretty important, when it was a free event terminals covered a lot of stuff they meant that with the intake phase all we had to do was let people know that a particular sim was about to open, someone with estate access went there and opened it up to the group. At which stage people would be able to rush in and grab the plot they wanted.  
The terminals would deal will most the management requirements for the plots giving people control over the title, description, music and media streams, giving them stats on how many prim etc etc.  
The terminals also fed a lot of information back to a central server. Allowing for a lot of information to be passed onto people who needed it.

#### At the End of This Stage

Still no camps actually sorted out but all major builds should be underway, roads placed, Parcels cut and terminals in place. There is admin in relation to the terminals and as soon as that happens then start releasing random

### Rollout

This was always done a sim or batch of sims at a time. One person with estate access would set it live and TP out.. (or hope to..) That is how quick these things went. (literally on the rollouts of plots we would be in a group chat trying to guess how quick the plot would go, watching the lights blink out on the systems web dashboard.)  
Personally what I would probably go for is over a set time period release a random plot at a random time.
