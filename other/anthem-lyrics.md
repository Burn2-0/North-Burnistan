[Verse]  
In the sizzling realm of dunes and relentless sun,  
Lies the quirky nation where satire is spunt.  
North Burnistan! Oh, the pride of the quaint,  
An anthem that chuckles, with nary a restraint.

[Verse 2]  
Where the tunes wander free like a camel in jest,  
Our song soars over sands, a lyrical fest.  
A chihuahua strums a sitar,  
in a sight so bizarre,  
Help us escape here-arre,  
but laughter bizarre!

[Chorus]  
Oh, dashing dunes, where the bold winds blow,  
To in North Burnistan, don't go.  
Under the vast, star-lit expanse we band,  
Celebrating our whimsy, in this vibrant sand-land.

[Outro]  
So here’s to North Burnistan, may our song never end,  
Except when we forget the words, my friend.  
With each whimsical verse, our spirits expand,  
In the glorious, joyous, sandy land.  
OH thy're 700. RUN..Run  
Wait.. no…. it was for fun!
