# Bungo : About

Well I didn't get around to fully completing this before my exhile from north-burnistan.. 
What started as an off-hand comment in a back-channel conversationm, Suddely developed into the national past time.. 
But like fight club it ended up being driven under ground, when the glorious leader found out about it.
Problem was she didn't understand what it was and thought it was a tasklist and so kept winning.

> Really did start as off-hand comment about bad-leader bingo.
> I thought I'd make a playable version to make a fellow exhile chuckle.
> Then the complaints system got shutown.. so I had the great idea..
> Making the bingo so that if you checked something it would ask:
>  * if you wanted to describ what happened.
>  * with or without your name.
>  * and then sent it to a spreadsheet.

> OR
>  * It could accept a notecard or texture.
>  * And send that to a secure offsite server.
