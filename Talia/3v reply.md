{ This is a reply I was working on but then the meeting happened. I am sat here now in the gap between having slept through the 5am meeting and when the meeting minutes eventually get posted... This wasn't directly sent but has been here. }


> Dear Burn2 Community,  
> I regret to inform you there was a recent year ban put into place on a staff volunteer, DJ Puddles decided by the 007 group, which was then updated to a permanent ban by Burn2’s estate owner, M2. There has been no formal procedure in Burn2 for delivery of this news, so as RC I am sharing the following:

I with the exception of going to here the excuses I refuse to take part in Burn2 unless this is resovle with a full investigation. 

> “As the registered owner of Burn2, a Burning Man Project Director, and the court of last resort for Burn2, I have made the decision to ban djPuddles from Burn2 due to what I have determined to be continued intentional disruption and manipulation. This ban is permanent.
> -m2Danger Ranger”

{ Intentional distruption? you mean like a cacophony? and please if manipulation is a concern do check on the conduct of the other leads if puddles did manipulate then the disruption came because it was not in thesame direction as some others leads maninipulations. }

{ Oh and I've been told that there is damming evidence and that it's been seen by Leo, and also that the 007 have had no hand in this is based purely off the chatlogs from the ranger channel. Also that Puddles would not want this going to trial.. but I can't see said evidence. 
So if the 007 have no hand in this how does leo know what the eveidence is? 
If the 007 had no hand how come the initial message from 3v about it was "On behalf of the 007"?
If it's so damming then surely puddles would have stopped stop running around uaeig chaos when you informed her of what it was she was atually banned for?}

    

I have emailed M2 myself. I hope for a replay. I do have other ranger contacts but i would range not get them invovled. I made him veryu much away that he might have been hasty and only hearing one side of the story from the people that were have complaint made against them was ni not was going to get and uniaded opinion.

> There was a lack of ranger support services due to available rangers needing to recuse and alternate rangers and overseeing RC offline or unavailable, the ranger FLAME process was initiated and not fully executed. Our 1 available assigned ranger kicked the matter upwards to escalate for help in investigation, ranger protocol allows for kicking matters upwards when support is needed. Those involved in the complaints pressured for expediting case investigation which resulted in escalation to request advice from the BMP Meta Regional representative Scotto who has been involved in prior year incident events. Then an additional request of the escalating situation to the 007 team was submitted this week moving upwards to the registered owner of Burn2, M2 into a permanent ban situation. Unfortunately once the owner is involved there is no undoing of the procedure or written process for appeals written in Burn2 documentation. 

I also informed M2 that my most reliable form of ranger support recently has been Aragorn the Rangger AI I trained.. ((Bunsens older brother is a ranger don't you know ;P okay he is not a ranger.. but he'd done a far better job that...a  lead/ramnger here who had had me ask for their help numerous times over the past year...

> It is unfortunate that another ban resulted due to recent incidents and I hope I have shared enough information to the community for consideration moving forwards. Due to the sensitive nature of those involved in the incidents we ask that discussions are kept towards solution based thoughts of our shared future.  

It's weird isn't it.. "Another ban".. it's almost like maybe you are not getting the right people and you an baning victims.. 

> If there are any questions about this, please talk with the Burn2 Regional Contact, 3V (3vilyn Vortex). 

Well concisder my applicable for ass rc to be on hold then... sorry 3v that went in before xmas... 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following section are my comments as RC to think about:

> Re-evaluation of leads ability to preside, escalate or refer to a separate forum for moderation is needed to be implemented in my opinion. Current staff is unable to fulfill current policies. What is the solution to this? Suggest evaluation of policy and change to have alternative solutions for conflict resolution (do we need a new group?) 

You got it spot on and then messeded but but saying Ability.

> Current model: lack of rangers, kicking upwards to 007, no alternative mediation options, no appeals process or counseling to help banned members to return home 

oo7? oh yeah the jack boo secret police...
  0 transparency... 
  0 ability to know uf there are ulterier motives in play... 
  0 abilituy to know if the rules were followed...
  0 ability to know if it's not just skye and leo... 
  0 ability to know if puddles actually cgot a consensus beweet then... 
  0 trust in a fair heaving whilst they hide in the shadows...

  Why if they make fair decisions show they ned to worrry.. 
  Not even like they need to actually do the banning.
  For the first time in a while mention of their actually doing anything comes up and it's 3v that actual had to do the hard stuff.
  They are given a free passs in terms of being accountably for their actions.. it's ripe for coprruoption.

>Solution options: 
> Develop a separate community led group for conflict resolution

You mean like RIST..  -.- cause that started so well..

> Train and retain more rangers 

Need volunteers for that... 

> Train community and leads in Ranger FLAME principles and expand who can investigate a complaint in the absence of available rangers

On of the leads is a ranger  and refus to help various people.. 

> New incorporation of Burn2 organization to address self-governance using bylaws 

```

Talia : what would this look like in practise? 
        New incorporation of Burn2 organization to address self-governance using bylaws 
Aragorn : Incorporating a new organization like Burn2 to address self-governance through bylaws involves several practical steps and considerations. This new entity, focused on self-governance, would need a structured approach to effectively manage and facilitate its goals within a community like that of Burning Man, or similar environments. Here’s a practical outline of what the incorporation might look like:

1. Establishing Purpose and Principles
Define the Mission: Clearly outline what Burn2 aims to achieve with self-governance. This could involve enhancing community engagement, ensuring equitable participation, or fostering a sustainable event culture.
Adopt Core Principles: These should align with the broader ethos of the community (e.g., the 10 Principles of Burning Man). Principles might include radical inclusion, decentralization of authority, and communal effort.
2. Drafting Bylaws
Structure of Bylaws: Develop bylaws that provide a framework for decision-making, conflict resolution, and operational management. This includes defining roles, responsibilities, and the scope of authority for various positions within the organization.
Participation Guidelines: Outline how members can participate, contribute, and make decisions. Ensure that the bylaws facilitate open participation and transparency.
Amendment Procedures: Establish clear procedures for future amendments to the bylaws, allowing the organization to evolve with the community’s needs.
3. Organizational Structure
Leadership Roles: Define roles such as a Governing Board, Committee Heads, and General Members. Each role should have clearly defined responsibilities and powers.
Election/Appointment Processes: Detail how individuals will be elected or appointed to various positions within the organization, ensuring fairness and community involvement.
4. Membership and Involvement
Criteria for Membership: Set clear, inclusive criteria for who can join Burn2 and how members can remain in good standing.
Engagement Strategies: Develop strategies to actively involve members in governance, such as regular meetings, feedback sessions, and online forums.
5. Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
Mediation and Arbitration: Establish mechanisms for resolving disputes within the organization, possibly drawing on the FLAME method or similar conflict resolution strategies.
Enforcement of Bylaws: Detail the process for handling violations of bylaws, ensuring that it is fair, transparent, and consistent.
6. Legal and Regulatory Compliance
Incorporation: Legally incorporate as a non-profit or similar entity as required by local laws, which might involve filing articles of incorporation and obtaining tax-exempt status.
Regulatory Compliance: Ensure compliance with local, state, and federal laws, including those related to gatherings, fundraising, and non-profit operations.
7. Communication and Documentation
Regular Updates: Keep the community informed through regular updates, transparent decision-making records, and open lines of communication.
Documentation: Maintain thorough documentation of meetings, decisions, and policies for accountability and continuity.
8. Evaluation and Adaptation
Regular Review: Periodically review the effectiveness of the governance structure and make adjustments based on feedback from the community and changing circumstances.
By following these steps, Burn2 can establish a robust framework for self-governance that supports its mission and values, engages its community, and adapts to changing needs over time.

> Want to be involved in solutions for Burn2? Please join the succession team!

Would I be serving burn2 or the regine of North Burnistan?

> It is my observation there needs to be an urgent updating of Standard Operating Procedures. Our world is different from the other regionals, misunderstood and volunteering is a hefty time commitment for everyone that happens across all time zones in real-time. We lack the people power to manage it all 24/7 to allow for radical inclusion.
Yeah prime example is the meetings.. You want me to get the list of items that either didn't make it or slipped throguh the crasks.
The Cujrrent method of dealing with adenda point submisiosn is sh!te adn just a method of control. 
e.g. the thirday 9pm meeting.. rns an our till 10 slt.. tehn the person whioc  is one of how few people wioth the aabilities to post it's leater for them so they get put off till the next morning but if not full nights slew that now leaves for  abotu 3 horse to get them... just it's anthing is comming up that my beintesting till

You know your loosing your metrics until this is sorted.. 

> Current model: M2 is sim owner and pays the bills, Regionals are endorsed and supported by BMP but BMP is not liable for any actions or resolutions arising from BM Regional participation activity or events. 
> Future solution: Burn2 must become a self governing community, pay the bills, manage & moderate Burn2 community and production volunteer staffing.
  
OOo you mean that increasing Traffic might be a good idea..  and trust me unless you are lucky enough to hit some meme. It's a slow steady progression.
