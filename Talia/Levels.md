# Levels
## aka Talia's Grand Scheme


I've brought this up a couple times now.. That BM on the open playa is wide and expansive. Operating on a single does not leave a lot of wiggle room for people. Just the other week I made the suggestion to Cuga that it could be position for DMV to have some wide open spaces to test vehicles on or even step races..  
Imagine a main stage on it's on level.. or even just an open playa stage where act that would be more visually taxing didn't almost affect everyone else.  
Or effigy burns… another good example.  
So 4 additional sub levels? we could have:

- ###### Build platform can remain for builds. 3950m

((I would move it right to the top of realistic build heights however 3950 would probably be best.. 4k is where things starting getting squorly so that would provide a good 50m vertical build space.))

- ###### "Regional Burner" level 3180m

    We could emulate Kiwi burn or BC burn (Or pirate nights or other stuff that needs to go against build aesthetics),  
((My build that I did After Sundays meeting at 2k is an example of what could be done with this. Entire sim area builds in completely different areas could be used for showing off other regional builds. e.g. Imagine how high pitched a Squee of excitement Neko would make given the chance to do a mini Kiwi burn..? And in rolling lush green hills… Or I believe beach burns are a thing..))

 - ###### DMV for racing and testing, 2380m

((Did submit a notecard to Cuga suggesting this..))

 - ###### Performance level for effigies and larger performances. 1580m

((I did mention this before as a possibility.))

 - ###### Open Playa.. 808m

     For anyone needing a sparse space for Burner Playa stuff.. Drum Circles out on the player for example.  
     Bring back the art department.. and have a large area to display artwork.

 - ###### Ground level - Gerlach and Camps. 26m

((Note the list above goes top to bottom in terms of altitudes. I've also sandwiched them so if goes quiet/sparse to loud/busy to quiet/sparse.))

If we were really sneaky we could do something like have rezzers to hide things unless people needed them. ((waits for the audible gasps and muttered whispers of Lag to subside.))  
Please keep in mind who is suggesting this. Why would I suggest such a heretical thing… Because the biggest factor to lag is exactly how much people have to download in terms of textures.. The amount of avatars with the insane amount of textures they contain, the far that render weights mean that Tri efficiencies goes out the window for attachments and that avatar physics is the biggest contributor for lag there is.  
Your average avatar will also have their draw distance set to around 128ish.. If you split everything into sublevels even 500 m apart means you can easily stop people from needing to download anything more than is needed.  
((The levels I posted on the list supersede the 500m guestimate))
