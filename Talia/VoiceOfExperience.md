Voice of experience here being rejected/ejected from something without being told exactly the reason. 

Well that does many things. None of them produtive or positive. 

Mostly in terms of image, obviously with the ejected person there is a lot of hurt. Not knowing what the issue is means it could be anything.. It could be them.. more likely they will find an issue with the gorup the ejected from. To other people. The person ejected not understnading the reasons will investigate themselves the go around and ask for people opinion of what happened they do this ALOT. They will attempt to question everyone they know of being invovled. They will relay their first of events to anyone that will listen. 

There is this thing called "Toxic Positiivty". THe ranger guide has an example of it. There is the specific example to never tell someone to "Calm down". In this situtation peoples natural reaction in seeing someone they know hurting is to look to What is actually really good advice but in that situation it's toxic. The advice is to "Let it go.". In that persons mind... Those three words are made into "This person doesn't understand. I just explained this situaton that is hurting me. For which I had to recount the entire experience thereby reliving it. Even if it wasnt at the forefront of my mind it is now and I am back to the moment it happened. This Family member/friend/person could listen to what I just said and not get it. Thhey are not who I thought they were I need to find other people who get what I am feeling so that I can show I am justified in feelng this way.." and so the person goes looking for more people for validation. 

It's a very nasty loop to break..  VERY nasty... it's very damaging to the person that is put into that postiion. They face writing off people that are trying to help them over and over. It's very defitintely a exponentially steepening downwards spiral.

Puddles was part the reason I broke mine. 

I reapplied to be a mentor at some point at the beggining of last year. My experience with that was at a level that I assumed that I was a sure thing.. for a voluntary role. I was rejected with a boilerplate letter delivered by a proxy. The decision makers were unknowns. I didn't get a reason. In my mind that didn't add up. How could a mentor group whose entire purpose was to help people grow send that? What was i supposed to do with that? If there was at the very least a reason they I would have a path moving forwards. So by the time October came around I was not in the best of places... I felt trapped I had got myself a lifetime account for secondlife during the time I think might be the reason for what happened. So I was heavily invested in trying to work out at the very least what had happened. 

I bumped into Puddles at an open deck event when this crazy fairy on a unicorn turned up, I didn't really pay her that much attentioon beyodn "oooh how odd.. fairy on a unicorn... eh, secondlife.." but the place we were at has trivia questions to  which I answer one with "England". She wasn't paying attention hadn't notice the trivia and replied "Oh cool me to..." we slowing focused down to the point that we both drink in the same pub. 

Anyways we get to chatting they say they are perf lead at burn2 and I amrelay that i was DPW lead at Burning Life. She points out that plots we open for Octoburn and I shoud come take a look. I had been to Burn numerous times before that but it was the first ime I caught a hint of what I remembered from Burning Life. I realise I had never expereinced it from the point of view of a participant. So I took a chance an got a small plot for myself.

I later ended up doubling the size of my plot and gifting a further 2 small plots for people that could afford it. 

But  in terms of volunteering my services the extent that went was building a big sign on my plot during the build period which simply said "Script Clinic". I couldn't ask for anyhting.. the thought of asking and being once again rejected (all too familiar expereince at that point.) was too much to think about. That included asking for roles. The Sole exception to that was seeing Puddles running around like a blue arsed fairy. I asked the least I possibly could and said if she needed an extra camera for stock footage and B Roll. I explained where I was at as many of the things I could thing of that could cause issues.

The event wasn't without issue but Puddles took it all in her unicorns stride. I didn't really feel like I had been a help on the grand scheme of things. but directly after Burn was Manifestations. So given the team was exhausted from the burn event I resolved to make up for things and ended up covereing the majority of the events in the following week. Culminating in a stream Where I stream talia streaming from secondlife acting as if she was the streamer investigating a new world called Sansar (I had built a greenscreen in Second Life and had this weird meta going which ended un in the final stream which was so complicated I needed a flow chart to explain...) 

So yeah.. at a time when I was on a rapidly decriasing downward spiral Puddles offered me trust I didn't get anywhere else tht single action help me  turn things around. 

That is not to say I am better long way from it. e.g. at xmas I went to visit my parents as is tradition, They had been on the list of people slowly getting alieanted.. most memorable thing about Xmas was getting in an argument with my Dad evertually breaking down in flood of tears before explaining what was going on...

Also not to say I have let go yet.. I have been talking with the CEO of secondlife am actally having a conversation... That is how long and far this goes.   

So seeing a boilerplate letter from and anonynous source that has stock pleastires within it but is actually a rejection being given to the person that helped me recover from the result being sent one myself. That tripped a few fuses.

Well At least Puddles had had some effort put into hers but I hope it's noticeable how thse appear. 

And in terms of why I felt assured that based on my experience why I thought I was a sure thing.. I've spent more time in secondlife as a mentor than not. I was not only a mentor I wen ton to become a member of CertDev whcih was the group of mentors and other specialists that worked on putting together the certifications for Second Life. I helped writed the LSL testing. From the wa I operated at Burning Life I was asked to join the Moles. I left there with a glowing letter of reccomendation from Micheal Linden. I still get recognised as a good mentor by the old crew and when I've been to WH I tend to get asked questions.
