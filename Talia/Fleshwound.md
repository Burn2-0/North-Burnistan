Okay, This is going to be a little controversial. As a way to quickly conduct a poll. I've just opened a group inworld  called "B2 Reformists" This is mostly just to ascertain a number of people that think things are not right currently.  I've run a quick straw poll around a good number of the major camps from the last Octoburn and it really is looking to be the majority of camps are pulling support for burn2 in sympathy for what happened to puddles, there are a few I have yet to ask, but my estimate in terms of the drop in traffic of 2/3rds  of the traffic that camp from camps is looking to be fairly accurate.

I have put in an agenda item for a triage survey. Just to establish exactly what this misjustice is actually going to cost. 
Please don't delude yourselves into thinking every thing will be okay if this just get swept under the rug. Remember that it WAS myself and Puddles that were running the metrics for the last even so I know exactly where the traffic was pulled. I have not accessed those files, This is purely from the memory of having worked on those files, memory of the locations of the major camps having been B2.TV streamer needed to know where active content would be.
 
I am honestly trying to do what I can to save Burn2 now, My initial concern was for Puddles having had a similar thing happen to me at SL20b.. There I didn't get the support that Puddles has received so my initial concern was to make sure she was okay.  She is going to be fine and significantly missed. Were she not, I was perfectly happy to have left Burn2 to support her.  But as I said, She is going to be fine and "her major concern now is that Burn2 is not Torn apart by this and Burn2 gets the reform it needs so nobody can be treated so unfairly or summarily banned again".

There is definitely things that need to happen before trust can be repaired and this needs to start happening ASAP. It would be great to have some support with this. I've done what I can on my own and this was mostly so that I could bear the responsibility of my actions and not force that onto others. 

The Group I've started inworld is free to sign up for the default membership should be hidden. The  owner of the group is myself and I have made the title of that role "Primary target" and added a note to that role accepting responsibility for that group.

[07:25]u53rn4m3 talia.tokugawa: I should further note I am not intending on leaving any of the groups so if I suddenly vanish know that it is not by my choice. Take that as further evidence of what I am saying to be true.
[08:29]huntresscatteneo Huntress: I have always loved the way there is different 'truths' in life, each person has what they see as the utter reality of a situation, and then there are those that support them that believe them completely as they would not lie.  Thing is there is not always lies and truth, there is sometimes just different views of things.  With somewhere like Sl, you have the people involved, the conversation picked up by those in range of various others, the time mess around wor whose words were said i what order, and then of course the visual component.  Take for example someone saying 'move it to here', as they stand their av somewhere for you to see.  Can someone see in a chat log where that is and if it is reasonable?  Or what about tone, can we see when some one is saying great it is finish on to the next stage vs about time what took you so long?  I how about Done, that is I have had it with you vs, fine done, there you go you got what you wanted?  So many ways to interpret things especially when you weren't there and only get presented with one side.
[08:51]u53rn4m3 talia.tokugawa: Two people sat on opposite sides of a table asked to describe a mug sat in the centre of the table would argue over which side of the mug the handle is. The fact remains that the mug is a mug.. 
The mug in this situation is the damage that has been caused needs to be established to try heal from it and one person is denying the existence of the mug.
[09:03]huntresscatteneo Huntress: There were disagreements, it all blew up and lots of people waded in to a situation that few actually have any true knowledge of, plenty think they see a mug, maybe some see coffee.
