# My Ban

> Dear Talia Tokugawa,
> Subject: Burn2 Membership Status 

> I regret to inform you of an important decision that has been made regarding your membership in Burn2. After escalation of recent events following the ban of the avatar DJ Puddles, Burn2 SIM owner & Burn2 Discord owner, M2, has decided to impose a permanent ban on Talia Tokugawa, Sally27 and Bearded Lady. 

> "When a ban is placed on an avatar, it is a result of the behavior of that avatar. No other avatar may act as a proxy or a representative for the banned avatar in order to continue the banned behavior. No builds, signage, or communications may be erected, or placed in Burn2 on behalf of a banned avatar. The posting of messages from a banned avatar is a continuation of the banned activity and is in violation of the ban."

> This decision was not made lightly. As a valued volunteer of Burn2, your contributions and involvement have been appreciated. However, several recent incidents have occurred that violate our community guidelines and standards, which are in place to ensure a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment for all members.

> The specific reasons for this decision include:

> Personal directed attacks posted publicly in Discord: 
> On 5/12/24, you engaged in posting public attacks on an individual in the Burn2 community Discord server community chat channel which is in direct violation of our Discord community’s code of conduct, which clearly states public personal attacks and inflammatory posts are not ok. 

> Discord Moderator warning issued: 
> On 5/13/24, you received a warning from Burn2’s Discord moderator, Freia, to be mindful of the CoC in reference to your post topics. Reposting inflammatory posts on behalf of a recently banned avatar and spamming server together with banned avatar’s ALTs is also in direct violation of our community’s code of conduct, which clearly states personal attacks and inflammatory posts are not ok.
> Planning Meeting topic disruptions: On 5/19/24 Talia made multiple meeting topic requests to demand meeting focus of her choice which was the recent ban of DJ Puddles and to bring up an older ban on Shendara Destiny.

> Disruption to Community Harmony: 
Your actions have led to significant disruption and discomfort among other members of the Burn2 community. After previous warnings and attempts at resolution, the pattern of behavior persisted.

> Our community’s guidelines are established to protect the well-being and harmony of all members. They are designed to foster an environment where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued. The decision to issue a permanent ban is a measure of last resort, taken only after all other avenues for resolution have been exhausted and/or unable to be resolved due to resource load.  
> We understand that this may come as a disappointment to you, and we regret that it has come to this point. However, we must prioritize the collective well-being of our community. As of 5/22/24, your access to all community facilities, events, online platforms, and activities will be permanently revoked.

> If you have any personal belongings within the Burn2 community SIM, they will be automatically returned to you unless earlier specified as a gift to the community. 

> We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this matter. Should you wish to discuss this decision further, please feel free to reach out in writing. While the ban is permanent, we are willing to listen to any feedback you may have and provide further explanation if needed.

> Thank you for your attention to this serious matter.

> Sincerely,
