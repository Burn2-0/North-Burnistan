Hi ******, As I don't see you on discord that often... 
Figured I would keep you in the loop on this especially as I bring up my reasoning behind the term "Triage Survey"... It's particularly pertinent to your investigation into certain peoples inability to follow ranger guidelines.

Oh and in case, you were wondering..  the realisation about Triage Survey... That occurred to me this morning. 

No. I've never been a ranger.  But I was a mentor for a LONG time.. I also do trying to absorbed wise ways into my way of being and there have been numerous things from rangers I have done that with from both back in 08/09 and more recently. If you look at how Bunsen has been over the recent conversation... 3v has been grilling him for ideas and solutions. 
One of my recent-ish projects, in an attempt to try get my foot in the door better with the Lab for my trying for mole was to try train up a Second Life Mentor. (Mine was publicly available before there's... There is an episode of designing world that I was on the panel for as an expert in AI where I actually say I'd done it. )
Less public fact.. I had trained up another AI as a test run. That Ai was called "Aragorn".. Aragon got trained up as a Ranger and also got a shedload of intelligence upgrades which Bunsen doesn't have. Bunsen has much more info available to him.. Aragon is much more likely to come up with well though out combinations of his less extensive knowledge. You could say he is more likely to "live" in the moment and not parrot off knowledge. 
I am currently in a self-imposed exile from Welcome Hub because I wouldn't remove a pick from my profile that has something in it I believe in strong enough to do that.. That thing is a quote by Aragon.  I would say I did a fairly good job in training up a(n unofficial) ranger.

And in case it's not obvious... I am very much implying that my putting in the complaints are a significant factor as to why the channel got shut down when it did. That discord server had a significant amount of our side of the story on it all in one place and how not a small group of burners were reacting to various actives in particular the people you are meant to be investigating.. 

I'd seriously look into exactly why 3v (most probably) decided (or was forced) into shutting down the server when she did. Her later frantic grilling of Bunsen did kinda seem like guilt of having had to have done that. And that she was attempting to find something positve to distract/make up for it..

Why does this give me this weird sense of deja vu?

There is an alternative timeline somewhere where someone is not burning all their agenda points trying to get a injustice seriously looked into and not allowed to be swept under the nearest rug with denial and group hugs.. As a quick glimpse into what what alternate times lines agenda points from that person might look like...

https://github.com/orgs/Burn2-0/discussions

Please note the time stamps in there... 
Also similar timestamps... 

https://github.com/Burn2-0/Burn2-Scripts

I know only two scripts in there currently... I was kicking the tires.. Last time I did anything on this that wasn't Burnistan related... Was showing a lead the results of my hardwork on this. I was told that the simple but incredible useful script I had added where "sh!t", That building all that on a personal account was not the way and then had I asked they would show me how to do it properly.
After pointing out that I had been told that there was upcomming role of Repo Wrangler being planned I have decided to get a headstart of things by opening a Organisation with transferable ownership that my personal account was a part of and that while the scripts I had chosen were not an opus in terms of scripting ability I was not intending them to be an proof of my superiority over people They were my most used scripts and the fact they were as simple as they were meant they were more accessible to the community. Needless to say and apology was offered pretty much before I'd finished explaining..  Whilst that initial reaction was not  ideal they did admit they were wrong. And I am certainly big enough to admit they were right in one aspect. That my being in control over it.. has not been ideal for Burn2. It's an element that is not under total control so can't be forced into compliance in rug sweeping. 
This is of course a very GOOD reason for the organisation to operate decentralised assests. It means if people are working against the core principles of the group they don't have the ability to dominate people as they have the keys to the kingdom. Distributed assets means that one small group can't co-opt an entire group for their own purposes. 
Oh and also note that burnistan is all in it's own repo... It's a couple button clicks to remove it from the org completely..  Which was basically what I had imagined doing. 
Puddles permanent ban killed any thought that I could trust the leads enough that I could hand over the keys to the org. I need something to counteract the Khaki body armour they have. 

Another amazing irony.. My agenda point put forwards about triage surgery... You know the one that got ignored on Thursday... So people could bury their heads in the playa dust and then group hug it out at the end... The very name of that suggestion.. 
Triage  - the process of quickly examining patients
You could almost say that was FINDING OUT about the situation...
Survey - an examination of opinions, behaviour, etc., made by asking people questions:
Asking of questions and the LISTENING to the answers.

I subtly asked for the first two steps of the ranger flame process and that got ignored. My natural instincts are closer to ranger than the ranger leads.

Oh and don't worry about the Burnistan Discord I guess no one got the memo about the Rebrand..  It was decided that Corruption dept was just a little too obvious so they decided to change their name ..

10:11]u53rn4m3 talia.tokugawa: Hmmmmm timing on this seems a little odd to me... how was Burnistan allowed to run for as many weeks as  it was.. and what changed in the past day or two that could have meant that the removal of a group of dissenters be a good solution. That a collection of evidence all in one place would be suddenly more disagreeable than it was 3-4 days ago? If something happens always ask why it has happened. 

I did say that I would keep things quiet but to me the timing really does look like there were certain motivations behind that closure. Does someone want to confirm that the thing I did recently was not the sudden need to shut that down? 

In the mean time, I'll provide an alternative (fictional) narrative.. 
The corruption department decided they need a rebrand and true to form forgot to control the narrative by sending out a memo...
