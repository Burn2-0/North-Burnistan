# Crafty's Second (and probably final) Meeting.

 

 

Thankfull Crafty basically has a handful of people on his friends list so the amount of editing in this is almost nothing. 

All I am doing is highlighting anuything I said with spacing and what it was that was said that I am responding to with spacing and a bullet point

I should say I did over the course of the meeting hand around a note from Talia. I left iSkye till last as she was most likely to boot me for it.

I had a thank you from two people. No one else reacted...

That note had originally been for Leo but I tweaked some of the direct refernces. I will admit it's still quite pointed, I figured people who knew that they were no involved would work out that I was just sharing with everyone.

As I arrive on the radio station they were talking about the fourth of July... I got a little confussed.

[09:05:20] iSkye Silvercloud (iskye.silverweb): OK I am chairing this morning, let's get started with ground rules

[09:05:26] iSkye Silverweb: GROUND RULES FOR BURN2 MEETINGS

[09:05:28] iSkye Silverweb: • Participation in Burn2 is entirely voluntary. Please consider carefully if you want to participate and follow the 10 Principles.

[09:05:34] iSkye Silverweb: • All of us, Burners and Leads, have a right to expect respectful dialogue and discussion at meetings in accordance with our CoE.

[09:05:46] iSkye Silverweb: • Anyone who attempts to hijack a meeting, or resorts to negative accusations and insults at others will be warned once by the meeting chair. If they refuse to stop and continue that behaviour, at the request of the meeting chair they are liable for ejection from the meeting so the rest of us can get on with business. 

[09:05:57] iSkye Silverweb: 1. We follow an agenda at each meeting.

[09:05:59] iSkye Silverweb: Prior to meetings we can add agenda items to the spreadsheet found at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bNQvuCdSkJe_stP6fEkXxGP4O6f74BB3cELyVqFykNo/edit?usp=sharing

[09:06:01] iSkye Silverweb: Just find the tab at the bottom for the current month & day of week.

[09:06:14] iSkye Silverweb: If available, a link to the notes from the previous week's meeting can be found in the first column of that sheet.

[09:06:22] iSkye Silverweb: At the beginning of each meeting, there will be opportunity to add anything that needs to be discussed, to the agenda.

[09:06:25] iSkye Silverweb: Once we agree to start the meeting, NO MORE ITEMS should be added to the agenda for the current meeting.

[09:06:37] iSkye Silverweb: 2. We take turns. 

[09:06:39] iSkye Silverweb: Meetings are conducted in text.

[09:06:41] iSkye Silverweb: NOTE: local chat is recorded by notetakers at meetings, and is often shared between Burn2 leads for informational purposes. 

[09:06:45] iSkye Silverweb: If you wish, you can IM the notetaker and ask for your name to be redacted from your comments on meeting notes.

[09:06:49] iSkye Silverweb: Topic discussions can flow freely, but if chat gets too fast or heated, the moderator for the meeting may ask that we slow down. 

[09:06:53] iSkye Silverweb: 3. We ask everyone to please do this: 

[09:06:55] iSkye Silverweb:     a. Use COMMENT or QUESTION in local chat when you would like to say something or ask a question. The meeting chair will watch for those and try to call on you when it's your turn to make a comment or ask a question.

[09:07:01] iSkye Silverweb:     b. Please wait to be called on so everyone gets a turn.

[09:07:07] iSkye Silverweb: PLEASE be respectful and considerate of your fellow Burners.

[09:07:11] iSkye Silverweb: Insulting or inflammatory language is not part of the Ten Principles!

[09:07:19] iSkye Silverweb: We have important things to talk about and decide, and limited time to do it.

[09:07:24] iSkye Silverweb: THANK YOU for helping to have GREAT meetings!

[09:07:46] iSkye Silvercloud (iskye.silverweb): anyone have anything they'd like to add to the agenda?

The note Sent 

---

When you have time to actually sit and properly absorb.... 



I know how you react to my shares.

I've been filming elsewhere as well as here.. 

Friday I was filming for Circle Mental Health. 



    https://youtu.be/GUqfwoIKopQ?t=677

   

 I know  I am not LGBTQ... but you don't know how much I can relate.. 

 Just so you know... just so you are aware of what you are doing... 



Keep in mind.. I got a ban note that for two of the accusations, the rule that  I got banned for was introduced in that notecard... 

That is against the majority of international  humans rights....you can't convict someone on a law that didn't exist until after the actions. That cover  half of what I was banned for. 



I spent weeks after that ban and trying to speak to a ranger... I think it was last week maybe that I finally got to speak with a ranger... the day after I spoke with a ranger.  Neon got banned.



Rangers SOP is Banning is a last resort.

Rangers SOP is to have a ranger Flame if that fails....

Rangers SOP is to then have 007 Flame Then if that fails ....

Then is when a ban is considered.



FLAME is Find Out, Listen, Analyse, Mediate and Explain.

Findout and Analyse I wouldn't expect to be involved in... 

Listen "MIGHJT" be something I wouldn't have noticed.. 

"Mediate" and "Explain", How precisely did I not have two instances of each that were recognisable as such BEFORE I got banned?



Please... EXPLAIN... This.



I don't know if it's been decided to bury it or not.. but as RIST seems to have done nothing since the rerport I was going to conduct a survey of my own. The differences with my Survey... It is Radically Inclusive. i.e. It's not restricted to people I think might not give me a favourable answer. So I am asking you the one question on my survey: 



Do you think my ban was right?



TT
