# My Ban vs RIST vs 10p

Little bit of back history here. 




This was a reply to someone over the fact that my entry for the RIST team had seemingly been dissallowed.

> **2 responses were from those no longer in good standing at Burn2**
> 1 response was clearly a fake response as the information provided was not associated with who they were claiming to be
> **This left** the total responses accounted in this report at 41.






The other thing that report makes no mention of... is exactly how much i tore apart every single reason that i had been against all the rule been banned for... no official warning... no three strikes... no ranger involvement at all.... beyond receiving the stock notecard to say " we received your complaint and rangers are being assigned but don't expect anyone to actually talk to you....".. ((The ranger policy breaking notecard)).... no flame... my complaints for un-rangerly conduct, which the survey clearly shows i was right about, just vanished... my actual survey response details something far worse for them than just being crap at their roles.... So because I dared to call them on that crap... I get banned... and not one is even allowed to talk on my behalf as anything to do with that subject is now a taboo subject. Where is Inclusivity? Where is Radical Self Expression? Where is Participation? Where is Immediacy? Where is Communal Effort...?  The only things to do with the principles... They Gifted me.. (gave expecting nothing in return) The ban. Forcing me in to a position of Radical Self Reliance...  And Restricted everyone's Self Expression in an effort to apply the Leave No Trace policy to an avatar... To Decommodify any value I might have to people....Trying to make any communal effort, I might want to make, any participation, any inclusion, valueless... Actually I am wrong.. To actually bring them up is likely to cost you the same fate... No Civic Responsibility. At best you could almost say that My Ban had hints of Immediacy as it was rush through at such pace it ignored all the rules.
