Astounded, in a word.

There are many other words too. Some I have shared with people.

So in the preparation of the survey to see how the community currently feels. Even if I have been excluded  from the team who is putting it together. It's not exactly a massive leap to work out that I am not exactly happy with things. If I were on the team I would want to know the outliers in terms of sentiment. To establish how far off average I would need to go wiht my questions.

People keep saying "It's not about the discord thing..." well it's partly about that... and besides Puddles herself I am probably the most knowledgeable about it. But it's not about that It's about collecting data from the community about what is going on curently. 

((Despite it being so obvious that even my AI could pick up on it.))

In RL I worked at a lead gen marketing company. The entire business model as basically working out who to advertise to, collecting data from them and then selling that data to our clients.  i.e. I spent the past six years creating forms/questionnaires, collecting the data from them and then displaying that data in a variety of different ways. I also dealt with privacy, GDPR and all that side of things too.. 

And then there is my addiction to the creation of Google sheet spreadsheets...Given the number of spreadsheets I did for sl20b would have thought that would be known. 

I was told that I wouldn't be accepted at sl21b when I made a joke about it. I am unsure on the wisdom of arbitrarily disallowing someone from something if someone is not sure as to the reason. Just sent a mail to Brad requesting a clarification as to what my punishment entails for the things I can't be told about. 

Of course the other thing that could have had me excluded was my suggestion as to the source of the data..Suggesting that getting access to the account where the agenda points were sent. i.e. checking to see how much actually gets submitted. 

I know I send a lot that never makes it so that does happen.. but how often? If the survey team is investigating the lack of engagement. Surely finding out if people feel like they have been heard would be sensible.
