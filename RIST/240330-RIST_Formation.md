PROPOSAL:
This was 1st presented at the Community Meeting of 3/31

My original proposal on Sunday's agenda was for a team to develop a survey for our community to express their views on the use of remote participation at Burn2 meetings. This has evolved over the past several days because I have received feedback regarding other facets of meeting participation. 

I envision forming a team tasked with crafting a comprehensive survey aimed at gauging community sentiments regarding attending Burn2 Meetings, including remote participation. It's imperative that the survey is designed to foster transparency, with multiple stakeholders granted access to real-time results.

I'm open to relinquishing leadership on this team to community members in pursuit of fairness and consensus. However, I believe having a designated lead within the team is necessary, and I'm prepared to fulfill a liaison role. I have been approached by one Burner, Lyric, to help head up the development of a survey for our community. Please see either of us to be a part of this team OR to submit any questions for the survey. We want to include a diverse group of us Burners.. 

We live in an age where technology can absolutely help us grow as a community. The vast landscape of remote participation solutions offers a wealth of possibilities. In this busy, modern age, accessibility is key. Drawing from my involvement in a range of community groups, including state courts, where inclusiveness is paramount, we've successfully integrated platforms such as Zoom and other virtual applications to facilitate VERIFIED attendance.  

I truly understand the needs of security expressed by several of us. There are some measures being proposed that would allow a human interface to this technology and a layer of additional security and transparency on who is attending meetings. I also understand that many are skeptical of some applications of AI and technology. We need to survey our community, our goal is to increase participation at community meetings by a variety of changes and adaptations. The use of a "TOOL" such as Discord to participate in meetings is just that, a tool.
