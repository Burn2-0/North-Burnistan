This was what I actually submitted for my entrying to the RIST Survey.

## RIST SURVEY ENTRY
        
Well, The Ban of my main avatar is certainly a bit of a hinderance. 
* But before that happened…The dislike of discussing anything "negative" and preference to just bury those things leads to them festering and then exploding in a way far worse than it would have been had they been dealt with when the items were originally asked. 
* The burying of topics also led to one of the reasons for by Ban. After being told once that I should only  submit one topic per meeting. I complied and did that. However as my topics got supressed in the last meeting before my ban when I had said multiple topics All of those topics had been submitted to different previous meetings except for one which was the one topic I had actually submitted for that meeting and had been supressed. 
  So my bringing up multiple topics in that final meeting and that being used as part of my ban was directly  due to the suppression and lack of even acknowledgment that they had been received and not accepted for whatever reason.
  i.e. I was aware that they had all been submitted and have video to prove that, I was never made aware that they were not still in the running to be potential discussion points. 
  That led to this:
  [2024/05/19 09:07]  Talia Tokugawa: I would like to add my want for the agenda point about needing more info about puddles ban that was truncated at the end of last weeks meeting resumed.. And I would like my agenda Point that I had submitted for thursdays meeting that besides the automated response has not been acknowledged… That was Triage Survey… which I realised earlier today was the FL from FLAME. And I'd quite like to know why my agenda point submitted for today has not been acknowledged… That one was asking plan and simple if there was actually any point in my trying to submit them…  And that is my not bringing up the other agenda point not of my submission which I am fairly certain is definitely the least pleasant on that sits there ignored in the pool of unwanted agenda points.  Oh and Poll.
  [2024/05/19 09:08]  Talia Tokugawa: I can add more if you want… but that is just the ones I've had missed for my ration of one per meet
  [2024/05/19 09:08]  BeardedLady: I have a topic for submission when you are ready
  [2024/05/19 09:08]  Leondra Larsson: so your topic is a triage survey, Tallia?[2024/05/19 09:09]  Talia Tokugawa: No.. My TOPICS… More info about puddles.. cut short last sunday
  [2024/05/19 09:09]  Talia Tokugawa: then triage survey the topic ignored for thursday
  [2024/05/19 09:09]  Leondra Larsson: more about Puddles? then?
  [2024/05/19 09:09]  Leondra Larsson: ok
  [2024/05/19 09:09]  Zoren Manray: Comment:
  [2024/05/19 09:09]  Talia Tokugawa: then todays topic is should I even bother attempting to add agenda points when they get ignored..
	[2024/05/19 09:10]  Leondra Larsson: Bearded Lady what is your topic for the agenda
	[2024/05/19 09:10]  BeardedLady: Yes, I would like to add an agenda topic motion for a vote of no confidence in the Rangers Lead Leondra, that She steps down, pending the outcome of the serious (and now multiple) allegations of 'abuse of position’. With reference to the community poll, that currently stands at 92% in favor (11 votes to 1). 
	 Furthermore, I think the community has a right for transparency, accountability, and the following questions to be answered:
	 * Leondra claims there were problems with Puddles for”Years”. Puddles says there were no complaints against her and has waived her right to privacy over that. How many official complaints did Rangers receive about Puddles in the past 2 years? When (if any) were those official complaints received and by who?
	 * Puddles claims she had filed complaints of ‘abuse of position’ against Leondra and iSkye. Were Leondra & iSkye involved in reporting to M2, just before Puddles was banned?
	 * There have been claims the 007s did not have consensus, the Burn2 Meta Ranger told
	[2024/05/19 09:10]  BeardedLady:  Leondra that “he could not act until Puddles complaints had been investigated” by Burn2 Rangers according to Burn2 policies, but this did not happen. Two Rangers have resigned saying Puddles did not receive fair due-process. Exactly what was told to M2 and by who immediately prior to her being banned? Were Leondra & iSkye (the subjects of Puddles complaints) involved?
	 * Are puddles complaints about ‘abuse of position’ by Leondra & iSkye being investigated? Have you, or will you now stand down as Rangers Lead pending the outcome of those investigations Leondra?
	 * Why are the communities efforts to seek legitimate answers on these critical issues of Trust, Abuse of position and Corruption being suppressed, submitted agenda topics ignored, meetings adjourned with questions unanswered and online servers deleted?
	 * Was Shen suddenly banned while working at a Burn2 event, without warning by M2, just like Puddles, for protesting about Rangers Leadership? When will the Burn2 Leadership cease being in
	[2024/05/19 09:10]  BeardedLady:  denial and stop the cover-up of the truth, admit that serious injustices have taken place and acknowledge the urgent need for transparency, accountability and reform?
	[2024/05/19 09:10]  Talia Tokugawa: Thurdays meet was a prime example..
	[2024/05/19 09:11]  Leondra Larsson: there's quite a bit there, and I can try to answer what I can without breaking confidentiality
	[2024/05/19 09:11]  iSkye Silvercloud (iSkye Silverweb): Wait I thought we were looking to add items to the agenda for planning stuff? Not start discussion?
	[2024/05/19 09:11]  BeardedLady: Puddles has publicly waived her right to privacy over this, she told me and I posted it in the community server publicly
	[2024/05/19 09:12]  Leondra Larsson: We have an agenda for the planning meeting.
	[2024/05/19 09:12]  Talia Tokugawa: puddles has given permission to talk about anything with regard to the banning
	[2024/05/19 09:12]  Leondra Larsson: but others have not waived the right, so I cannot talk about others
	[2024/05/19 09:12]  Talia Tokugawa: yeah you want to see the videos of when I submitted my topics..
	[2024/05/19 09:13]  Huntress Catteneo: all that is not planning?
	[2024/05/19 09:13]  Huntress Catteneo: needs a diff meeting?
	[2024/05/19 09:13]  Talia Tokugawa: you are talking nearly two weeks ago for the first one..
	[2024/05/19 09:13]  Leondra Larsson: Let's get on with the regular business, we'll see how much time is there for discussion.
	[2024/05/19 09:13]  Talia Tokugawa: I believe the mass walk out was what of the big stressfull times with herbie right?
	[2024/05/19 09:14]  Zoren Manray: COMMENT: I'll also note that again we didn't know even what repeating agenda items would even be in discussion until mere hours before this meeting. While understandable that last moment items will not be there it is a troubling practice as those of us not in the know can never be sure what, how much is already on the agenda, and if there will even be time for more items.
	[2024/05/19 09:14]  BeardedLady: So in other words, just like last week, you are going to ignore the submitted topoics until last item then adjourn to supress it being discussed?
	[2024/05/19 09:14]  Leondra Larsson: these meetings are about PLANNING,
	[2024/05/19 09:14]  ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): Comment
	[2024/05/19 09:14]  Talia Tokugawa: Soo PLAN to have to deal with this…
	[2024/05/19 09:14]  Leondra Larsson: I am willing to stay until almost 11
	[2024/05/19 09:15]  Leondra Larsson: please don't try to hijack the agenda
	[2024/05/19 09:15]  Leondra Larsson: I posted the original stagement about meetings
	[2024/05/19 09:15]  Jeff Olhoeft (jolhoeft): Are we adding an agenda item for this?
	[2024/05/19 09:15]  Talia Tokugawa: Why would I want to hijack the agenda?
	[2024/05/19 09:16]  BeardedLady: That would be your perspective Leondra, another one is the Leadership, with a blatant conflict of interest, are “hijacking the meeting” by wilfully ignoring the community, and the communities efforts to seek legitimate answers on these critical issues of Trust, Abuse of position and Corruption. With submitted agenda topics ignored, meetings adjourned with questions unanswered, online servers deleted, a flagrant disregard of the available evidence, the damaging exodus of Rangers, volunteers and Burners, and a continued suppression of any attempts to get to the truth.
	[2024/05/19 09:16]  Leondra Larsson: • Anyone who attempts to hijack a meeting, or resorts to negative accusations and insults at others will be warned once by the meeting chair. 
	 If they refuse to stop and continue that behavior, at the request of the meeting chair they are liable for ejection from the meeting so the rest of us can get on with business.
	[2024/05/19 09:16]  Leondra Larsson: thaty was written by Puddles
	[2024/05/19 09:16]  Talia Tokugawa: I mean I get a fair shake at being able to address things
	[2024/05/19 09:16]  BeardedLady: Leadership, YOU, are hijacking the meeting
	[2024/05/19 09:16]  ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): comment (2nd request)
	[2024/05/19 09:16]  Leondra Larsson: yes Lily
	[2024/05/19 09:16]  ღ Lïlÿ Vøn ℳᴀɢɪcღ (LilyVonSchtupp): I believe to give the most attention to any issues, we should have a breakout meeting. It is hard to communicate when you are running against the clock.
	[2024/05/19 09:17]  Leondra Larsson: agreed
	[2024/05/19 09:17]  Talia Tokugawa: All of us, Burners and Leads, have a right to expect respectful dialogue and discussion at meetings in accordance with our CoE. 
	 Everyone is entitled to a voice and opinion, but nobody has the right to abuse others and make demands.
	[2024/05/19 09:17]  Leondra Larsson: let's get to the topics
	[2024/05/19 09:17]  Leondra Larsson: Popup Party setting up for 17th July - iSkye for Ilia Sojourner
	[2024/05/19 09:17]  Talia Tokugawa: right to expect respectful dialogue and discussion at meetings
	[2024/05/19 09:17]  Leondra Larsson: iskye?
	
	There was suggestion of a breakout meeting.. did that ever come about?
	This apparently was one of the reasons for my ban. Where I quote the rules of the meeting and get ignored. I am literally stating the rule at the end of that dialog that I had the right to expect dialog and discussion, after having post multiple submissions that had all been ignored from previous meetings... all of which I had the Right to bring up... And this event appears on my reasons for being banned.. Because I brought up the fact my rights according to the code of conduct were being ignored as much as my adgenda points. 
	
	Just so it is in one place: 
	Planning Meeting topic disruptions: On 5/19/24 Talia made multiple meeting topic requests to demand meeting focus of her choice which was the recent ban of DJ Puddles and to bring up an older ban on Shendara Destiny.
	
	Did I mention Shen once?
* I have multiple times brought up the points on marginalisation. 
* When I did put forwards constructive suggestions they were never really given a fair shake of the stick. 
	* When I put forwards a topic about the transparency of the meeting minutes that was misslabeled as My wanting to use AI to take minutes which at the time was a Hot potato topic and despite my attempts to correct the mistake iSkye persisted that mistake and so I spent ages attempted to defend myself that I was not wanting ai to do it I had wanted to take a look at an alternative to the often biased summaries that were being posted up to that point. 
	* The following meeting to that say the introduction of the discord recorded so I shelved the document I had written in response to the prior meeting and decided to give that a fair go.
	* I think the next thing I submitted during the initial phase it was decided to teach me a lesson so for the first time ever it seems to get an agenda point submitted for a meeting there was a discussion and a vote. This was the first time I think I noticed Skye's control mechanisms. Where in open debate there had been many people sitting the fence or actively on my side.. just before the vote iSkye had said that she was "VERY DISPLEASED" and seemingly from that point on everyone bar one who's said to me afterward that they agreed with my point but hadn't been aware that the vote was intended to go that direct about their vote with me.. 
	* My most successful agenda point ever was the suggestion about the GitHub repo as a way to improve collaboration and somewhere to store scripts for burners to use on their build.. That was greeted with luke warm ambivalence. 
	* My Levels suggestion which derived from a my having made vocal opposition to various points on the pirate popup build most specifically about the fact it had open water which were against build guidelines.. I had suggested multiple alternatives including caustic projection lights and then had built an entire sublevel specifically to provide an alternative place for it to go... I had suggested to Cuga about a "DMV BackLot" Level before in a notecard and that combined with this cemented into an idea and I tried to bring items for many other people to try make as many people gain something from the idea as possible. 
	  The idea obviously went down like a lead balloon. But there was about 5 actual questions and I inadequetely partially manage to answer 2 of them.. mainly can the subjects of discussion came in at such a rate one person could not hope to keep up... 
	  It was how ever the first time that I had noticed iSkey seeding her opinion as each new topic came up she would instantly switch from the topic she was on and make sure to get a very early comment into that topic of conversation. 
	* Suffice to say the planning meetings should be just that... nothing else. 
	* AND there should be adequate measures in place for other aspects of group discussion. 
	  * Prior to my levels suggestion I had posted the following to Freia on the subject of Discord. And at some point layout I believe Leo had said that the intent of discord had been to facilitate some of these:
		* Test Server.. can never have enough servers.. if we have  test server that is invite only we could test the and share video without needing to test on the live server. Then show videos of the new feature function on the test server.
		* The pictures dircectory.. Think that would be better and a folder of "Media" where you could include "pictures", "video", "music",etc etc  Those would be forums where each event would be a different post…Encourage people to share more…
		* Idea Distillery:  A forum type thing where people could post ideas for development..  Again hopefull increasing involvement… a place for people to introduce ideas and work on them collaboratively getting them to a stage of being ready to go before planning.
		* Haves and Needs: Fairly obvious.. place for people to post if they need something.
		* Stories: Could do weekly themes or something a forum design again each theme gets a post and you request people best anecdotes and stories…. Winner gets the choose the following weeks theme… and kudos….
		* Many bots…. oO not all bots include any AI but do provide many additional functionality…
		* Making use of Discord Events which I believe can be hooked up to Google Calender… They are also displayed as the users local timezones. 
	* Prior to those suggestions I had also submitted the following document as an agenda point. The only thing that got a look in was the org chart.. Which I didn't include above but that one was introduced in such a way as to have four different people felt the need to post me links about how to find out the organizational structure. Which it's blatantly obvious that I knew exactly where it was as I had used it to create the example.. So having to present an idea to a group of people that "I'd misled and then wasn't grateful for their helpful links"... made things awkward due to misreprepresentation when they didn't need to be. The remainder of the points never saw the light of day. 
	  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PrjHuO3zNqY_vEhuxY_R-nHImBmCxTSbxnpCwJ7Aa3U/edit#gid=0
	  The end result of this... I got paired with iSkye to create this for the website.. It was very shortly after I'd had a near breakdown in front of her which she seemed to not want to do anything about so that project idea was pretty much stillborn.
	* After this particular thing whilst I was putting together the Git Repo. I had been told that a role "Repo Wrangler" was upcoming so I decided to get a head start on that and put together something so i could at the very least be able to know my way around, know what was possible with it, what aditional features might be useful, put together some example structures and even some templates for the scripts to use. 
	  I had come across one particular feature that was particularly interesting.  
	  https://github.com/orgs/Burn2-0/discussions
	  This in my mind would be perfect as a place to bring ideas that were not ready for planning meetings. It would allow for people to submit ideas as and when they happened without worry of hijacking meetings.. Those ideas could be discussed by the community and developed. To align with the community.. as more people got on board with however an idea went, when they were happy they could vote on the idea. The leads could goto this like and check the top few voted ideas and see if they were ready for "primetime" if they were then they could be progress onto planning.  
	  THIS AND THIS ALONE WOULD HAVE STOPPED SOOOO MUCH CRAP.
	* There is however no official guidance on how to put anything forwards. There appear to be just 2 methods to have anything put forwards... Agenda Submissions and Complaints. you don't see people discussion stuff on any of the official channels so I assumed they were not the places.. The only place it seemed logical to submit ideas was the planning meetings.. and if that was not the guide lines I was never informed otherwise. 
	* I would be remiss to not bring up that the discord discussion was left to run for 60+ days of bi weekly meetings where myself and puddles there seemingly under constant attack despite constantly sticking to our points. 
		* The leads as Mediation Specialists  of many years service should have realised that this was a stale mate much quicker than they did. 
		* This is especially comical as another reason for my ban was:
		  ***Disruption to Community Harmony:***
		  *Your actions have led to significant disruption and discomfort among other members of the Burn2 community. After previous warnings and attempts at resolution, the pattern of behavior persisted.*
			I would like to suggest that given the length of time that this persisted this crime was the leads who let it draw out as long as it did Long before It became my crime. 
			I had submitted a complaint against both Leo and iSkye to suggest basicaly this and am well aware:
				* It had been received.. 
				* That no one was assigned to look into it... 
				* That shortly after that Rangers were told that they were not going to be investigating complaints for the foreseeable future.
				* That the Complaints form was disconnected/disabled.
				* That the next thing that came after that was my permanent ban. 
				* The permanent ban with a generic nonspecific quote from m2. (Doesn't mention any names and is written in document style legalese not as you would if directed to another person.)
				* The permanent ban went from a friendly warning from freiya on the day of this aspect:
				  ***Discord Moderator warning issued:***  
					*On 5/13/24, you received a warning from Burn2’s Discord moderator, Freia, to be mindful of the CoC in reference to your post topics. Reposting inflammatory posts on behalf of a recently banned avatar and spamming server together with banned avatar’s ALTs is also in direct violation of our community’s code of conduct, which clearly states personal attacks and inflammatory posts are not ok.*
					Leo had obviously not see the text of that warning.. which arrived 15mins after when Neko and Lily had said about their mums/moms I'd shared some thing with them then redacted that but they both saw.. and ceased in what I had been doing independently of moderator interactions. Leo on the other hand had been screaming for my head by all accounts as I had paraphrased the contents on an IM discussion in which she couldn't argue my points and ended up blocking me.
				* Seeing that I am on the subject of my ban... I am not exactly sure how the last part of my bad is actually what it says it is.. 
				  **Personal directed attacks posted publicly in Discord:**
					On 5/12/24, you engaged in posting public attacks on an individual in the Burn2 community Discord server community chat channel which is in direct violation of our Discord community’s code of conduct, which clearly states public personal attacks and inflammatory posts are not ok.
					I named an individual or two yeah... But they are not attacks... I was describing what I consider to be attacks on me.... I don't get how that is an attack...? The people involved know damn well that I am just saying what happened... If what I am saying there is untrue investigate it... You can't just tell me it's untrue or an attack  without an investigation. 
					And if you really want to go down that investigation route maybe ask how a participant whilst in IM with a senior ranger nearly snapped.. Yet that ranger didn't mention that fact to anyone... 
					I believe that particular situation is on the Must Report list, Not having done so is a major infraction that is at the level of a ranger becoming not a ranger... 
					And for that matter... When I checked with Leo to see if she had had that reported to her. She as senior ranger was obliged to have reported iSkye for not reporting it and reporting the original event itself. 
					So please do investigate that one.. I am at your disposal any time you want to take a statement... You know the due process thing that was neatly sidestepped in my ban... Which again I am not even sure had come from M2 given the difference between Puddles' Ban which actually had puddles name in it vs. my 0-PermaBan in no time at all.. That Reeks of a falsified ban..  
					The fact that this all came directlly after I had placed 2 complaints against them  which received, got as much attention as asked Gemma to send out stock notecard #3 before both reports where found a nice deep hole to bury them where no one could find them.. 
					Oops. https://gyazo.com/56c36121f19ffe9e542ed2b8db1efd30
			
			Oh had that lot just comes from going through my ban letter and the items it references...  some of the ranger manual and a little discord group and a couple places specific IM.. 
			I've already got every discord IM of people that could be inolved.. discord community chatter from before puddles ban and all this years meeting logs. I've not even started to load any  of my inworld chatlogs.. 
			Do you really think that good things are going to happen if I go through them forensically?
			https://gyazo.com/5df38f15f2eb971e40f964e6cff9b9a4

Well aware that this turned into a bit of a wtf why am I banned but that is my main blocker with being involved with the meetings and as that is my blocker then other people are going to look at what happened to me and be fearful of the same happening to them in the future so are going to feel like the are unable to express themselves fully... which is going to breed an apathy as to if it's worth going to the meetings at all as if they are not pushing in the direction that the select few wish then they suffer ended up in the same position as me.. So Why Bother....
