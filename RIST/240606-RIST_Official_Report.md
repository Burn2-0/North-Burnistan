# Radical Inclusion Survey Report 
*(Okay I transposed it from google docs to markedown... - tt)*

Due to a recent debate at Burn2 the question was raised if we were being as inclusive as possible in facilitating participation at the general planning meetings.The community decided to form a committee to run this survey.
After several weeks of meetings we narrowed down the questions to what we thought were the most transparent and critical ones that needed to be asked at this time in hopes that the responses (or lack thereof) could give us some insight into how the community could be better informed and included in the planning process.
Unfortunately, at the time of this survey some of the alternatives and options for improved inclusion were eliminated abruptly, despite no alternate option being made available. The survey’s purpose changed to determining, in general, how aware people were of the planning meetings, member’s barriers to participation and to providing an avenue for members to express their feelings and ideas about ways Burn2 could increase inclusion.
In total the Radial Inclusion Survey collected 48 responses.This survey was open to all members of Burn2 who were in good standing at the time the survey was collected (May 12th through 26th 2024). Notably during that time period 174 users in the BurningMan 2.0 group are listed to have logged in. This indicates about a 23.5% response rate to the survey.

Of the responses received:
* 2 responses were duplicates 
* 2 responses did not have a second life name that could be associated with them
* 2 responses were from those no longer in good standing at Burn2
* 1 response was clearly a fake response as the information provided was not associated with who they were claiming to be
This left the total responses accounted in this report at 41.

Also people had an option to opt out of having their responses shared, Those responses are included in aggregate data but their written responses were not included due to that request.

Note there were only 40 responses in that last question due to one respondent leaving it blank

| Please describe any features or aspects, if any, of attending Burn2 public planning meetings in Second Life that you find unappealing or challenging? (only includes shared responses) |
| --- |
| I have the feeling that BURN was the same people planning the same things over and over. Restrictions like "no vehicles unless they are "Historically BURN designed vehicles, for example. |
| Don't know what is going on, no one will tell me because I am a nobody. |
| They are painfully ineffective. The agenda is always last minute, important topics are buried at the end of the agenda. Too much time is wasted on issues best resolved in one on one IMs |
| Am never home (Thu.) or awake (Sun.) during these times |
| Tend to ignore Group Chat Notices would prefer a Regular Group Notice |
| I find the incessant attacks on 'certain' members appaling. The constant disregard and shutdown of ideas and helpful projects with heavy bias is also appalling. I have been in at least 4 meetings to see these actions on NON-Inclusiveness and dictatorship has prevailed. I once was smitten by burn2. I had a very very special burn in Octoberburn that was very personal to me, now that is tainted. If management does not resign or CHANGE their dictatorship, I believe this community will fail and the sim will go bye bye. For a group of adults to behave this way would make me give a warning to change or i'd pull the plug on the entire operation, seriously. I may be a new burner and not that versed in all the ins and outs, but that doesn't exclude me from feeling what i feel based on what I have witnessed 1st hand. |
| The meetings are fine, its the time difference and times that get me. If they were held during the week earlier say around 4pm slt I could attend. |
| The Thurs. mtg, is way too late for me. Sometimes I try to avoid meeting if I think there will be argumentative, or people attending only to be disruptive. |
| the night one i am never on at that time.. Sunday I have obligations most of the time at that scheduled time |
| maybe i do not know, i just wanna to relax sometimes but my relax depend on me but not from environment) and same with perfomances |
| Drama |
| Never been to one |
| People trying to control the meetings |
| Too many people interrupting. Too much going off topic. Meeting needs a strong but impartial moderator.
for something that is as important for the event as the meetings because they are treated not as inclusive as time zone limitation and other responsibility. when I log in to sl my time is highly demanded because of my social and SL work status as well. |
| Huge amount or rules being posted at beginning of meetings is off-putting. Also rarely does anyone follow said rules in terms of use of "question, comment. " |
| When I'm unable to interact with observers in the meeting because they are not actually present in SL |
| Sometimes not at home during the meeting and only have my phone handy |
| I only have so much time and only so many spoons, I love being a part of the community in everything that I can give. Real Life Burner with Lead jobs for two of them. |
| I generally cannot focus well on process meetings. |
| The arguments have been draining. |
| There is again no way to attend other then logging directly into SL which sometimes is impossible if other events take me away form my home in RL |

## Section 4- Final thoughts and suggestions

| What suggestions do you have for improving the accessibility, safety and appeal of our weekly Burn2 public planning meetings? (only includes shared responses) |
|--- |
| Make it a party. |
| I would like to access the public meetings without needing to be logged in phisically in SL, for instance via Discord, as already demonstrated by DJ Puddles. |
| I am at burn2 to enjoy the event, see the builds and the beautiful avatars. Not to there to join leadership politics. | 
| limit the number of topics.. provide an agenda far enough in advance so people can prepare thier comments and "submit them at the appropriate time. Make the begiing of the meeting for "announcements/updates and let them be statements.. not Design sessions for 4 week out surveys. loop back to those issues for questions later. |
| Maybe Post Agenda in Group Notices |
| Yes |
| Everything you are doing is fine | 
| Remote participation platforms or apps. would be helpful. |
| I enjoy the occasional group hugs - and Miranda had a thing where we say something positive about someone or something that lifts people up. I wish we could do that every meeting. Helps us remember we're all in this together. |
| I can't think of anything. when i have attended I see there is a chair person who leads the meeting.. there is an agenda.. people can ask questions.. on the agenda or make comments or suggestion.. that is the way a normal meeting is usually run.. robert's rules ?? |
| Public trainings - I mean all perfomances must be trained before(i think) but where is the training room? |
| More attendance by higher ups such as 3V and M2, especially during times of conflict |
| I have played one set last year at Burn2. I was not aware that this meant ongoing involvement. That may not be a bad thing, I just wasn't aware of it. |
| stop circular arguing |
| STRONG moderator. Less interruptions. Less chaos. |
| No longer have the meeting being a fixed time in SL make it a discussion on discord linked to the website so you can chat in both places |
| Please consider adding "appreciations" to the meeting agenda. All business and no given space for gratitude makes meetings a little too businesslike and unburnerlike. I do like the hugs tho. :) |
| Simplify it, keep it to SL, maybe add a time, but allow attendance by proxy with pre-announced agendas. |
| Posting of chat log within a 12hr period, agenda items listed 24hrs before meeting. |
| My own community has weekly meet and greets that tend to be well attended and a lot of information is exchanged and improved on in a more informal setting. Official meetings are only a couple of times a month and the leadership make the decisions in the meantime. It's not easy to change, but perhaps change the format of the twice a week meeting to something that is less formal that instills creativity and socialization over being business like, something we escape to when we go to burns. |
| I do not have any suggestions |
| The meetings are working reasonably well. Other parts of Burn2 could do with much more defined and transparent processes. |
| Bring back participation outside of SL (on Discord or otherwise). Meetings should have repeating Agenda items listed far in advance. Agenda aside from last moment items should be updated no less than 24 hours before the meeting so it can be known what is being discussed. Meeting notes should be Realtime or posted within 24 hours after the meeting so they can be reviewed before the next meeting. Serious agenda items and agenda items added last moment that need consensus, should not be decided in the same meeting they are presented at. All these things should be common sense for functional and inclusive meetings! but we know why they are not adhered to. Some in power like the advantage that controlling information and keeping everyone else in the dark gives them. |


## Summary and recommendations
### Key Issues:
1. Repetitiveness and Restrictions:
    * The same individuals seem to plan similar activities repeatedly.
    * Restrictions, such as only allowing historically designed BURN vehicles, are limiting and frustrating.
2. Lack of Communication and Inclusivity:
    * Members feel excluded and uninformed about ongoing plans and decisions.
    * There is a perceived hierarchy that makes some members feel like "nobodies."
3. Inefficiency in Meetings:
    * Agendas are often prepared last minute with crucial topics pushed to the end.
    * Meetings spend too much time on issues that could be resolved in private mediation.
4. Scheduling Conflicts:

    * Calls for significant changes or resignation of current management to prevent community failure.

    * Meetings often devolve into arguments and off-topic discussions.
    * There is a need for strong, impartial moderators to keep meetings focused and respectful.
