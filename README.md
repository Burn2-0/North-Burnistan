## The Conception 

North Burnistan is what was a flight of fantasy born of a discussion I was having with someone over a discord link into a Second Life Meeting and the Drama that had been stirred up due to that. This is the start of the idea. This was inbetween the time after the initial 1 year ban but before the permanent full ban.

### This is the monolog leading into the conception of North Burnistan.

> Talia Tokugawa: Did the community at large agree to the "rule" or has it pass into law? or is it a stopgap waiting on the results of RIST..  Do we know how many consents are for or against it being enforced? Really isn't Discord being disable the result of a very small vocal minority getting all worked up about something the  don't really understand...? By silencing the discord have they not just silence any one that may want to speak against it?
> 
> [2024/05/08 00:59:34]  Talia Tokugawa: Lets sayy it was women's rights... Somone make a complain about the pitch of women's voices... the obvious answer for all the meetings from now on... women can come... but they must where gags.... because a few people apparently find the sound of their voices annoying... Which I know is a fucking ridiculous parallel... to make... but how is it differnt?
> 
> [2024/05/08 01:03:34]  Talia Tokugawa: So what have we got so far... secret police.. the silencing of dissenters.. as you saw in access group... within a day of anything mbad happening their is a cheer squad out in force on one of the major channels singing the praises of the great leader.. Kim Jong Skye anyone?
> 
> [2024/05/08 01:07:26]  Talia Tokugawa: you have state media... i.e. the website... I was reading through it the other day... the brochure on there... is the result of the community round table from 21 before the last political unrest when the upstart Herbie and his followers attempted a coup..

### This is the first instance anyone uttered the name of North Burnistan.

> [2024/05/08 01:11:30]  Talia Tokugawa: Welcome to North Burnistan....
> 
> [2024/05/08 01:13:02]  Talia Tokugawa: North Burnistan is not my "Home"...

### Then the very first thing I did to try keep things light hearted and remind myself to try not to go too far with things. 

> [2024/05/08 02:27:33]  Talia Tokugawa: Mind you.. as a member of the North Burnistan United Front I feel I must stay....
> 
>  Scene: A dimly lit basement in North Burnistan. A group of disheveled freedom fighters gather around a rickety wooden table, strewn with maps and various papers.
> 
>  Leader (standing at the head of the table): Alright, everyone, quiet down! We need to unite the groups for our push against the oppressive regime!
> 
>  Member 1 (enthusiastically): Yes! We, the North Burnistan People’s Liberation Front, are ready to lead the charge!
> 
>  Member 2 (correcting him): Uh, you mean the People’s Front of North Burnistan, right?
> 
>  Member 1: What? No! It’s the North Burnistan People’s Liberation Front!
> 
>  Member 3 (rolling her eyes): Oh, not this again. Who cares? We're all fighting for the same thing!
> 
>  Member 4 (scribbling something on paper): Actually, we're the Revolutionary Alliance of North Burnistan. We believe in a structured approach to—
> 
>  Leader (sighing): No, no, no! We're supposed to be consolidating our efforts, not arguing over names!
> 
>  Member 5 (muttering from the corner): Well, I’m from the North Burnistan Freedom Group. We actually do things instead of just talking.
> 
>  Member 2: Wait, when did you form another group?
> 
>  Member 5: Last night. After I left the meeting of the Democratic Liberation Movement of North Burnistan because they couldn’t decide on the font for our manifesto.
> 
>  Leader: This is ridiculous. Can we focus on our plan to overthrow the government?
> 
>  Member 3: Absolutely, but can we first address why the North Burnistan Brotherhood isn’t represented here?
> 
>  Member 1: They split from us because they wanted to start meetings with a folk dance!
> 
>  Member 4: And don’t forget the North Burnistan United Front. They only meet on Tuesdays.
> 
>  Leader (frustrated): Okay, okay! Let's at least agree on our common enemy—the government, right?
> 
>  Everyone nods in agreement.
> 
>  Member 5: Great, so our united front—what shall we call it?
> 
>  Member 2: How about the Unified Liberation Front of North Burnistan?
> 
>  Member 1 (shouting): No! It should be the North Burnistan Unified Liberation Front!
> 
>  Leader: Forget it. Let’s just call ourselves... “The Group.” Can we agree on that?
> 
>  Everyone mutters in agreement, somewhat deflated but relieved to avoid another name dispute.
> 
>  Leader: Fantastic! Now, let's plan our next peaceful protest... And please, no more new groups before lunch!

## But before that

This started a long time ago but this particular serious of event from my point of view started when I had put in an agenda point to a planning meeting my original point was that as the minutes of the meetings were being summarised there was a serious lack of transparency to anyone who didn't attend the meetings.

I was inspired to make the submission when someone had been made so angry they got up and stormed out of the meeting. I was shock to find that this event was not mentioned in that log and nothing negative had appear in the logs. 

I made the submission during the period at the begining of the meeting where it's requested that if anyone had anything additional to add to the meeting that they speak up and add it. So I had submitted in a document requesting greater transparency. 

As I was was short on time I had had  a chatGPT generate examples of what could be considered impartial versions of the chatlogs to compare against the actual written ones. I suggested once in that initial docuent that "maybe we could look at" Ai for this purpose. 

This concern about transparency was Labelled as my want to "Use Ai to generate the meeting summaries".  It was about the equivalent to forcing me into Gaga's Bacon Dress then kicking me into a shark tank to present my concern.

Numerous times in the following blood frenzy iSkye noted that she didn't like Ai and that she knew the community didn't like Ai in that conversation. She knew dam well that my concern had been about tranparency and not trying to promot use of Ai. As it was not only mention in the conversation we had before the meeting but I had actively tried correct her each time she tried misinform.

As a result of that meeting I prepare dthe following document. It includes the document I submitted, The chatlog of the lead up, the meeting and chat after the meeting. 

The meeting itself is split by the points that came up inthe official summary submitted so you can see how much time in the meeting went to a topic vs. in official summary.  To further prove the different I had a gpt right a summary for each section.  

I had also been through, annotated and hilighted points of note.

Additionally I had started writing out exactly what my history was with regard to AI to show how much I had been forcing my self to try remain on subject despite everyone wanting to make it about Ai.. Out of everyone there I was the person who most wanted to make that a conversation about Ai... Without question. 


[My first big meeeting break down - 20+meg image file](https://github.com/Burn2-0/North-Burnistan/blob/main/img/The%20Big%20Meeting%20Document.png)


I rushed to try finish it.. as a result I arrived at the next meeting where I had intended to originally put it forwards late.  When I arrived however Puddles was in the middle of introducing the discord link, which rendered the entire thing I did redundant.

So I sat down and learnt about the link instead. 


It wan't long of having that in operation before we had a group of people that all had similar complaints about privacy and safety and after 55 days of it being in operation their unfounded statements and impossible requests  that denied the reality of the situation had us turned off that hook-up

I do not mean to belittle concerns about privacy adn saftery they are important. So important that neither myself or puddles were willing to let this group conveince themselveds or anyone else of their delusions.

Good example of this is we found out that they believed tht if they were to bliock someone that their chat would become invisible to that person. It took videos showing what actually happento convince them otherwise. There were arguing points from a place of misinformed faebook "experts" up against people with actual experience who knew what they were talking about. 

Despite some of them having relatively good points that we were trying to filter the seemingly constant attacks to try capture the small percentage of what would now seem to be mostly artificially generated out rage. 

Puddles obviously had the incdient on the 03/03 (chatlog below)

Make your own judgement on whether from that alone it was worth a lifetime ban.

## Fastforwards a "little"

So, I seem to have joined the ranks of the exiled. I have been causing somewhat of a cacophony...
Might have gone a little far with posting the Merriam-Webster definition of fascism in a public chat and then providing examples for all most all the points to look out for.
